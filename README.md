# Hi! I am Ramya Pravallika ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Github Portfolio.

## About Me
I'm a Data Science enthusiast with a knack for uncovering insights from complex datasets. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills as a Data Science Intern at Tutort Academy (March 2023 - present), where I tackle real-world data challenges. Previously, I gained valuable experience as a Machine Learning Intern at Indian Servers (August 2020 - October 2020).
I'm passionate about leveraging data to drive insights and decision-making. I thrive on projects involving predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical analysis. My enthusiasm for continuous learning keeps me on the cutting edge of data science trends and technologies. I am extremely excited about working on Data Problems. When I'm not working or reading, I like to spend my hours actively (running/hiking/Weight Training) & tinkering on data science projects
